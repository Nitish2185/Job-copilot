# Progress

## Current phase

**Phase 2 - Go crawler** (starting)

## Done

### Phase 1 - Shared foundations (accepted 2026-11-02)

- Zod schemas: feed contract (FeedJob, snapshot, shards, closed shards, index, public companies)
  and the full data model (profile, projects, preferences, answer bank, jobs, scores, JD
  analysis, applications, queue, resumes, cover letters, files, companies, AI cache, settings
  with all defaults, local-only secrets).
- `skills.json` (432 skills, aliases, categories, ambiguous names with context patterns,
  `implies`), `locations.json` (75 countries, states, 230 cities), `fold.json` (accent folding).
- TypeScript tagger, experience parser, location parser, remote detection, text normalizer,
  snippet maker, and careers URL/HTML platform detection.
- Golden cases shared with Go: skills (202), experience (50), locations (88), remote (18),
  normalize (14), platform URLs (54). 513 tests pass.

### Phase 0 - Setup (accepted 2026-11-02)

- Prerequisites: Node 24.19, pnpm 12.16, Git 2.55, Go 1.27.3 (pinned in `go.mod`; the local 1.24
  install downloads it automatically). Chrome and Edge installed; Firefox to install before
  Phase 11.
- pnpm workspace (`shared`, `extension`, `site`), TypeScript 6.0.3 strict, ESLint (type-checked)
  and Prettier, Vitest.
- `shared` package with `config.ts` (app name, owner/repo, feed URL, `AUTO_SUBMIT_HOSTS`,
  politeness limits).
- WXT extension (React 19 + Tailwind 4): Chrome/Edge MV3 and Firefox MV2 builds, empty dashboard,
  opens on install and on toolbar click. `pnpm dev` opens Chrome with the extension loaded.
- Go crawler skeleton with subcommand stubs and the User-Agent constant.
- `set-owner` script (owner + repo), run with `Nitish2185 Job-copilot`.
- `ci.yml` (format, lint, typecheck, tests, both builds, audit; Go gofmt/vet/race tests/build) -
  green on GitHub.
- Docs: README, LICENSE (MIT), CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE, PERMISSIONS, DECISIONS, PROGRESS,
  REQUIREMENTS.

## Next

Phase 2: verify ATS endpoints with real GET requests and save trimmed fixtures; Go fetchers
(Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters, Workable if a stable endpoint exists); Go ports of
the normalizer, tagger and parsers passing the shared golden cases; state and diff; feed writer;
`validate-companies`, `discover`, `stats`; seed `companies.json` with 100+ verified companies;
`crawl.yml`; placeholder site deploy. Then tell the owner how to turn on GitHub Pages.

## Known issues

- Firefox build warns that new add-ons must declare `data_collection_permissions`. Decide the
  declaration with the store listing in Phase 11.
- Go race tests only run in CI (no C compiler on this machine).
- Default Gemini model name and AI base URLs are unverified until Phase 4.
- Spec items for the tagger, parsers and URL detection (7.4, 7.5, 7.9) stay unticked until the
  Go ports pass the same golden cases in Phase 2.

## How to continue

Read this file, then `docs/DECISIONS.md`, then the spec section for the current phase in
`docs/spec/`. Tick items in `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` as they land. Commit each feature separately
and push to `main` after every change, with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.
